## Hi there 👋

My name is Sarah. I was originally a midwife, and my interest for genetics made me graduate in molecular biology research. That's the moment I discovered that there was plenty of informatic work in this field. Today I am working at 42 School in Lyon to achieve that goal.

🔭 I’m currently doing an internship in bio-informatics, research & development <br>
🌱 I’m currently learning about machine learning and data representation.
