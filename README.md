## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Sarah. I was originally a midwife, and my interest for genetics made me graduate in molecular biology research. That's the moment I discovered that there was plenty of informatic work in this field. Today I am working at 42 School in Lyon to achieve that goal.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on the last project from 42 mandatory curriculum : Transcendance <br>
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about machine learning and data representation.
